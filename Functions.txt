Explanation of functions:

.begin():		initialize the module
.setOffsetTemp()	sets the temperature correction (used for calibration processes) it's 0 by default<<< added by Harvey>>
.readEmissivityReg()	reserved
.writeEmissivityReg()	reserved
.readEmissivity()	Read the emissivity setpoint ***
.writeEmissivity()	Write a new value for the emissivity***
.readObjectTempK()	returns the value of the object's temperature in degrees Kelvin <<< added by Harvey>>
.readAmbientTempK()	returns the value of the environment temperature in degrees Kelvin <<< added by Harvey>>
.readObjectTempF()	returns the value of the object's temperature in degrees Farenheith
.readAmbientTempF()	returns the value of the environment temperature in degrees Farenheith
.readObjectTempC()	returns the value of the environment temperature in degrees Celsius
.readAmbientTempC()	returns the value of the environment temperature in degrees Celsius
